title: Live Stock Monitoring Based from Drone Footage.
---

# Introduction: #
In this project I have developed an approach that detects and counts Livestock from footage of a drone. Latest CNN techiniques and image processing techniques have been used to accomplish the task.

# Methodology: #
First a huge number of images of cows and other Livestock were obtained by the drone.  Using these images training waas done using the state-of-the-are Faster RCNN technique.  A new indegenous algorithm is developed to count the number of cows from a continious video.

# Result: #
Final output video:
