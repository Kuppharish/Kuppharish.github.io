# An aspiring roboticist with passion for autonomus mobilty and manipulators

### More Information

I am a first year graduate student in Mechatronics and Robotics at New York University and currently working on localization and mapping of autonomus vechiles. I am also workin on kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators. Prior to that, I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur where I majored in Aerospace Engineering. During my time in Bachelors I worked on linear and non linear controls of mobile robots.

In past few years I have worked on different fields of robotics. I have worked on perception and path planning of Autonomus cars using computer vision. Later I developed Reinforcement Learning models to control a UAV and to direct it to land on a moving base. Currently I am working on mapping environmnets using point cloud data by a deep learning approach. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that can be used directly by the people and improve their lives.
