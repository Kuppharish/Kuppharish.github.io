title: Optimized Implementation of LOAM for Indoor Environments.
---

# Introduction: #
LOAM is a state of the art algorithm developed for Lidar SLAM. Many major developments have taken place after the influx of LOAM and the next major developement was the [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM "Lego-LOAM")


# Methodology: #
First a huge number of images of cows and other Livestock were obtained by the drone.  
Using these images training waas done using the state-of-the-are Faster RCNN technique.    
A new indegenous algorithm is developed to count the number of cows from a continious video.

# Result: #
